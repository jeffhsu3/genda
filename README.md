What is genda?
==============
genda is still very much in development and should not be used by others

genda is a python package that allows the user to import many varieties of 
genetic data and genda will parse the data, converting it to pandas 
dataframes. This standardization of data makes it incredibley simple to 
analyze data from different file formats. genda also has basic analytic 
tools built into it that allow the user to perform association tests, 
heirarchical clustering, etc.
